# Quality Assurance Exercise

## Overview

Here at ShootProof, we prefer to have a good idea of a candidate's technical
experience and analysis skills before proceeding with portions of our recruiting
process.  We believe that the exercise below will illustrate a candidate's
approach to working with technologies and methodologies commonly used in our
QA team here at ShootProof.

## Guidelines

The exercise consists of several different parts designed to showcase your
problem-solving and solution-implementation talents. There is not a single
correct answer; this is *not* an exam. We simply want to see how you approach a
business problem and the steps you take to solve it.

* This exercise should not take you more than two or three hours to complete. If
  your solution is taking longer, that's okayâ€”be honest and let us know how long
  it took and why you think it took that long.
* Be as thorough as you wish.
* All exercises are to be performed as if you were on the job.
* You may submit your response in one of the following ways:
  * Package an archive (ZIP, tarball, etc.) of your files and deliver it to
    your contact.
    * If working with a recruiter, deliver it to them.
    * If working with ShootProof directly, deliver to <careers+qa@shootproof.com>.
  * Fork our repository and open a pull request.
